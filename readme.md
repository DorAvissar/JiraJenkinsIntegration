### Workflow Steps

1. **Docker Compose Setup**
   I initiated a Docker Compose file located in a folder that outlines all the necessary services per the first requirement. I opted for Docker Compose to run all environments locally, aiming for convenience and efficiency.

2. **Service Verification and User Configuration**
   After setting up the Docker Compose, I verified that all environments were running properly, with each container accessible. Additionally, I logged into each site to create and configure user accounts as instructed.

3. **Jira and Confluence Linkage**
   To connect Jira and Confluence, I added an application link in Jira. Initially, this link didn't work due to issues with accessing `localhost`. I resolved this by using ngrok to generate a publicly accessible URL.

4. **Jenkins and Git Integration**
   To link Jenkins with GitHub, I installed the "Blue Ocean" plugin. This plugin makes it simple to connect Jenkins to GitHub by configuring a GitHub token. My next step was to create a webhook from GitHub to Jenkins. Here's how I set it up:
   - **Payload URL**: This points to Jenkins with a suffix `/github-webhook/`.
   - **Secret**: Defined in Jenkins using the GitHub token.
   - **Permissions**: Set according to requirements.
   - **Creation**: Unfortunately, the attempt to establish the webhook failed, and due to time constraints, I couldn't resolve the issue.

5. **Jira and Jenkins Integration**
   To connect Jenkins with Jira, I used the "Manage Jenkins" option. I entered the Jira URL, along with a username and password/token for authentication. After establishing the connection, I created a simple pipeline in Jenkins that would update a Jira issue upon a successful Jenkins build to confirm the integration was working.

6. **Pipeline Update and Git Merge Trigger**
   My next step was to add a trigger to the pipeline, set to initiate when a merge occurs in GitHub. However, the one-way connection from Jenkins to GitHub prevented this setup, requiring webhook-based integration. This is straightforward in GitHub's webhook settings.

7. **Final Step: Git Branch and Jira Issue Update**
   My final task was to check if there was a Git branch corresponding to a Jira issue ID. If such a branch was merged into the `main` branch, the goal was to update the Jira issue to "done."

### Important Notes
- I encountered a major issue with service interconnection due to the inability to access `localhost`. I had to create a URL via ngrok. In hindsight, utilizing a cloud-based approach with an automatically assigned external IP might have been more effective.
- Due to time constraints, I couldn't fully complete the task, leaving a few things pending:
  1. Establishing a two-way connection between GitHub and Jenkins.
  2. Completing the webhook setup.
  3. Adjusting the Jenkins pipeline to update the relevant Jira issue based on the task.

### Additional Tools and Technologies Used
In addition to the main steps outlined in my previous response, I also utilized the following tools and technologies to complete the work:

Jenkins Plugins
To streamline the integration and automation process in Jenkins, I employed various plugins, such as "Blue Ocean" for a more intuitive Jenkins interface and others that facilitated the integration with GitHub, Jira, and Confluence.
ngrok
To overcome local network limitations and make local services accessible over the internet, I used ngrok. This tool allowed me to create public URLs for services running on localhost, crucial for connecting tools like Jenkins, Jira, and Confluence.
Token Configuration
To ensure secure communication between different services, I had to generate and configure tokens. This included creating a GitHub token for Jenkins and defining tokens in Jira for secure access and integration.
PostgreSQL
The project required a database backend, for which I used PostgreSQL. This involved setting up the database, configuring user access, and ensuring proper connectivity with other services in the Docker Compose environment.
Docker Desktop
I ran all the Docker containers locally using Docker Desktop, a user-friendly interface for managing Docker environments. This tool helped me visualize the containers and troubleshoot any issues that arose during the setup process.
